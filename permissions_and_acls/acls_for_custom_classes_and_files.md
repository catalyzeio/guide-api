# ACLs for Custom Classes and Files

To start, /auth/all, get admin token in ExampleApp.

## Admin grants Bob Create on File

Give Bob the ability to create files for other users.

Bob tries again.

Drawback is that Bob can now create files for any user, not just Alice. Upcoming release will allow entity-level permission granting, allowing Alice to grant Bob only the ability to create files against herself.
